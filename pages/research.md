  NEUTRINOLESS DOUBLE BETA DECAY

[PLACEHOLDER] Physicists have postulated a process that, if observed, could answer some of these questions: neutrinoless double beta decay. Double beta decay is a rare second-order process involving the emission of two electrons from a nucleus simultaneously. In ordinary (two-neutrino) double beta decay, proposed by Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1935, two electron antineutrinos are released along with the electrons. Two-neutrino double beta decay has been observed in several isotopes. In neutrinoless double beta decay, proposed by Wendell H. Furry in 1939, no neutrinos would be emitted, and the nucleus would decay emitting only the two electrons. Neutrinoless double beta decay has never been observed. The process is shown on the right.

Neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay violates the rules of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Specifically, if the electrons are emitted without neutrinos, this violates lepton number conservation. Any process that violates lepton number conservation (such as 0νββ decay) opens the door to theoretical physics models seeking to explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe. Additionally, the observation of 0νββ decay would demonstrate that neutrinos are their own antiparticles and hint at a value for their Majorana mass component.
