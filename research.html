                            <h3>Neutrinoless double beta decay</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p> [PLACEHOLDER] Physicists have postulated a process that, if observed, could answer some of these questions: neutrinoless double beta decay. Double beta decay is a rare second-order process involving the emission of two electrons from a nucleus simultaneously. In ordinary (two-neutrino) double beta decay, proposed by Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1935, two electron antineutrinos are released along with the electrons. Two-neutrino double beta decay has been observed in several isotopes. In neutrinoless double beta decay, proposed by Wendell H. Furry in 1939, no neutrinos would be emitted, and the nucleus would decay emitting only the two electrons. Neutrinoless double beta decay has never been observed. The process is shown on the right. </p>
                        <p> Neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay violates the rules of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Specifically, if the electrons are emitted without neutrinos, this violates lepton number conservation. Any process that violates lepton number conservation (such as 0νββ decay) opens the door to theoretical physics models seeking to explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe. Additionally, the observation of 0νββ decay would demonstrate that neutrinos are their own antiparticles and hint at a value for their Majorana mass component. </p>

                            <h3>The challenge</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>In recent decades, several experiments have searched for 0νββ decay using increasingly advanced technologies. So far, none have seen a clear and reproducible 0νββ decay signal. The next generation of experiments will use ton-scale detectors, with superb energy resolution and exquisitely low backgrounds in the energy region of interest. If observed, the experimental signature would be quite clear but very rare. The signature would be a narrow peak at the energy of the decay, but so rare that we expect to see only a few decays in 5–10 years of data-taking with a ton-scale detector!</p>
                        <p> The CUORE collaboration has taken up this challenge by studying the 0νββ decay candidate 130Te. In recent years we have built and analyzed data from the prototype bolometric detectors Cuoricino and CUORE-0. The next stage, planned to start operations in 2016, is the largest bolometric detector ever built: CUORE.
